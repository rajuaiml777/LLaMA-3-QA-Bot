LLaMA 3 QA Bot
================

This repository contains a Python script that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library and the LLaMA 3 model to generate answers to user questions. The script uses a chat template to generate a conversation between a user and a teacher, where the user asks the teacher to explain SQL joins with examples.

Requirements
------------

* **Python 3.8+**
* **`transformers` library (version 4.40.0)**
* **`accelerate` library**
* **`bitsandbytes` library**
* **`torch` library**

Installation
------------

1. **Install the required libraries** by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run the script** using `python llama3.py`

Script
------

The script uses the LLaMA 3 model to generate an answer to the user's question. The input prompt is defined in the `messages` list, which contains a chat template with a system message and a user message. The script uses the `transformers` library to tokenize the input prompt and generate a response using the LLaMA 3 model.

Output
------

The script prints the generated response to the console.

Example Output
-------------

The output of the script will be a generated response to the user's question, explaining SQL joins with examples.

**Q: Explain SQL joins to me with examples.**
