# LLaMA-3-QA-Bot
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library and the LLaMA 3 model to generate answers to user questions. The script uses a chat template to generate a conversation between a user and a teacher, where the user asks the teacher to explain SQL joins with examples.
